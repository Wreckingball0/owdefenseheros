    <h2>Bio:</h2> Cheerful, creative, and optimistic, even in the face of overwhelming odds, Mei is a scientist who has taken the fight to preserve the environment into her own hands. She specializes in the study of abnormal climate phenomena and their effects on different ecosystems around the world. She strongly believes in preserving the world for future generations.<br/><br/><h2>Background</h2><br/>Though many blamed the planet's escalating, unexplained climate phenomena on the advent of new technologies, the rapidly growing omnic population, and drastically increased consumption of resources, the true cause remained unknown. To find a solution, Overwatch established a series of eco-Watchpoints at remote, critical locations worldwide. Dr. Mei-Ling Zhou was a member of this multi-year initiative. A peerless climatologist, she had introduced cutting-edge innovations in the field of climate manipulation that protected at-risk areas in Asia and beyond. She was assigned to the program's monitoring station at Watchpoint: Antarctica. An atmospheric anomaly above Antarctica was the basis of the base's research, but then, disaster struck: a sudden, catastrophic polar storm battered the installation and cut it off from the outside world, leaving the facility damaged and the scientists stranded. As their supplies dwindled, they entered cryostasis in a last-ditch effort to survive until a rescue attempt could be made. Before entering cryo, Mei made a recording, anticipating waking up and finding a wealth of data to examine (as she left the sensors on).<br/><br/><h2>Rise And Shine</h2><br/>Nine years passed before Mei woke up, not a physical day older due to being in cryo. Her cryo pod was reactivated once the base received an external message, albeit too weak to properly display on the base's terminals. Alongside Snowball (the base's droid), she got dressed, made tea, and looked at the data she'd collected, discovering that the anomaly was much worse than predicted. Snowball revealed that she'd been in stasis for nine years, much to her horror; surely Overwatch would have come for them in that time. She tried to communicate with the outside world, but the comms were down. The base however, had accumulated news reports over the years the comms were active, which revealed that in the interim, the Ecopoint had been considered lost in the ice storm, and Overwatch had been shut down. No one knew they were here. It was at this point that she began to wonder where her fellow researchers were, and rushed back to the cryo-chamber. She discovered that all of the pods bar her own had malfunctioned, and as a result, they had perished. She broke down crying, alone in the base, with only Snowball for company. She promised to get the data they'd collected to the world. Or at least try. Mei headed outside. However, the dish was broken (which prevented any outgoing transmissions), the base's vehicles were incapacitated, and looking out across the vast Antarctic landscape quickly discouraged any thoughts of hiking out. She went back inside, faced with isolation (bar Snowball), and the knowledge that the base's power wouldn't last indefinitely. She noticed the transmission that had been sent earlier, one that was being sent over Overwatch's emergency frequency. Perhaps someone knew they were here, but to find out, they'd need to reinforce the radio tower so she could climb it and access the dish. Over the next several days, Mei scavenged material to build an endothermic blaster and a makeshift antenna. She nearly completed it, but it was at this point that the base's last battery gave out. Snowball sacrificed his own power to recharge Mei's workstation, and as such, she was able to finish the blaster. Through it, she was able to use its ice properties to climb the tower and get to the dish. Using her antenna, she discovered that the message had been sent from Winston, urging Overwatch's former agents to get back together to face the troubles facing their world. Mei decided to answer the call. Before leaving, she paid her final respects to her friends before taking a sled of supplies, and hiked across the Antarctic landscape with confidence. To her joy, she found that Snowball (whom she'd taken with her) had regained his power, thanks to a portable solar panel she had taken with her.<br/><br/><h2>Mei's Adventures</h2><br/>At some point after this, Mei got in touch with Winston. He suggested she start writing a journal, telling her that people would find her "unique" perspective interesting. She made her first journal entry and made it available to the public while in the Yukon near Mount Logan, while testing her new gear. She concluded that it was in working order (a step up from a few days ago, when she'd accidentally frozen her arm), and began studying the local wildlife. Six days later, she decided to head to Asia, to investigate the abandoned Overwatch stations there. Before doing so, she took a break by flying into Los Angeles to see Six-Gun Killer. Two days after that, she was in Asia, investigating a mountain ecosystem (possibly the Himalayas). One of her avid readers is D.Va, who is fascinated with all the different places Mei has seen as the young mech pilot is not able to freely travel herself.</h3>
